Created as a solution to the Odin Project’s assignment:

Was not completed as a ‘pair-programming’ effort as suggested by the assignment.

Icons and sounds are either original or pulled from creative commons databases.

About the Pomodoro Timer/Clock:

Defaults to 25 minute work periods and 5 minute break periods.  Originally designed to enhance work productivity by breaking long tasks into smaller, easier-to-manage chunks.

Will play a sound when either the work or break timer reaches 00:00:00.  Maximum duration of either is 99:59.
